// long after it started healthy; the local DNS server's loop can end on a failed
// select; the policy rule can be deleted by something else on the machine. Until
// something notices, the stack stays "started" with the DNS policy rule installed,
// so every redirected name resolves to a loopback address with nothing behind it.
// Every supported site breaks at once and the program does not say a word.
//
// The wait is on kernel objects — the children's process handles and events the DNS
// components signal when they stop in a way they could not repair — so a
// component going down is observed the instant it happens, thirty milliseconds in or
// thirty minutes in, indistinguishably, and costs nothing at all until it does. That

// allowed to take, and a guess is precisely what this exists to avoid.
