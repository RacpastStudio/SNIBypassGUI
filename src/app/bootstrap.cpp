// ours are NOT equivalent:
//
//   Foreign (present, pointing elsewhere) — another copy took the name. The user asked
//       THIS copy for a shortcut and no longer has one, so repointing it restores what
//       they asked for. Whichever copy ran last owns the desktop, which matches the
//       copy the user is actually using.
//   Missing (not there at all) — the user deleted it. Recreating that would overrule
//       them on every launch, so a delete is taken as a change of mind and the
//       preference is reset to declined.
